## 🙏 About This Portfolio

This isn't just a website — it's a testimony.

I spent years chasing success, titles, and goals... but I found myself empty.  
It wasn't until I surrendered my life to **Jesus Christ** that I found true meaning, peace, and purpose.  
Now everything I build — every system, every project — is for **His Glory**.

> **Mark 8:36** — *\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\"*

This portfolio exists to share my technical skills, my faith, and my journey — to serve, not impress.
