## About Me

I build cybersecurity tools, OSINT systems, and symbolic intelligence platforms. My portfolio is not just a site — it’s a working simulation environment to show what I can do with nothing but code and commitment.

## Hidden Console Easter Egg

Pop open DevTools and type:

```js
initShadowOS()
```

Prepare for terminal override.
